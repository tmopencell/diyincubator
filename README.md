# Retrofit an old incubator and run from a web app anywhere in the world

I have come across a lot of old incubators that use old mercury thermometers. In general they are robust and if they still work it is just useful to be able to digitally record and monitor the temperature. 

## 1. Get the incubator
These are usually found left over from universities or from second hand auctions. The ones that use mercury thermometers are ideal from this project as they have a hole already in the top of the housing. 

## 2. Get the computer parts
You  need: 
 - One raspberry pi zero (or another model is fine as long as you have wifi). 
 - Three [DHT 11 senors]()
 - Raspicam
 - A 240V relay
 - (optional) usb webcamera

## 3. Assemble

## 4. Code to run

**Creating a timelapse**

**Running the DHT 11 and sending the data to a weapp**

**Creating a temperature selection button**
