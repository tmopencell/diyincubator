# Retrofit an old incubator and run from a web app anywhere in the world

I have come across a lot of old incubators that use old mercury thermometers. In general they are robust and if they still work it is just useful to be able to digitally record and monitor the temperature. 

## 1. Get the incubator
These are usually found left over from universities or from second hand auctions. The ones that use mercury thermometers are ideal from this project as they have a hole already in the top of the housing. 

## 2. Get the computer parts
You  need: 
 - Raspberry pi 3,4 or Zero (or another model is fine as long as you have wifi). 
 - DHT 11 sensor
 - Raspicam
 - A 240V relay
 - (optional) usb webcamera

 **Where to get them**
If you are in the UK you can be lazy and use this [amazon shopping cart](http://amzn.eu/7rWGZtP) but I find [RS Components](https://uk.rs-online.com) to be the fastest and cheapest (free next day delivery and no minimum order). They stock older raspi versions (3+) which are perfect for this project as well as almost infinite amount of sensors and other electronics. 

## 3. Assemble

I will talk about how I assembled my system but it is likely going to be different for you depending on what type of incubator oyur found. My incubator was a 

## 4. Code to run
